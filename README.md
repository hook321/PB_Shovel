Example
=======

Download a single image to the default `./photobucket/` directory:

```
python pb_shovel.py -u 'http://s160.photobucket.com/user/Spinningfox/media/Internet Fads/b217a64d.gif.html'
```

Obtain all the urls of a Photobucket Album, even subalbums, and put them in `links-<datetime>.txt`. This url file can be given to `wget` (just download all images) or [grab-site](https://github.com/ArchiveTeam/grab-site) (archive all links as WARC).

```
python pb_shovel.py -u 'http://s160.photobucket.com/user/Spinningfox/library/Internet Fads' -r --links-only
wget -i links-2016-03-20_02-03-01.txt # or you can use curl
```

Recursive Album Downloads
=========================

If you're an archivist, you would obviously want to download all nested folders in the current
album. This script supports this feature: just add `-r` to download these nested folders. Done.

Extracting URLs
===============

The `--links-only` parameter can be used to store all the image URLs in a text file:

`links-<datetime>.txt`

This file can then be passed into `wget`, `wpull`, or `grab-site` to archive the 
images to a sane directory structure, or to to WARC format.

Guest password
=====================
Got guest password protected albums which you want to download?
simply pass the password with the URL you define with the
-u/--urls argument like so:
```
python pb_shovel.py -u "password@http://photobucket.com/example"
```
